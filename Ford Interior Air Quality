# A Python program to print all different flow combinations 
# from a given set of venturis
#README
#when executed, this program outputs a .csv file
#.csv files can be easily extracted from in excel 
#for further plotting and data analysis
#
#When changing the number of venturis, change length 
#in line 16, add variable of v(#) within venturi sizes,
#and add v(#) to the combinations function in line 36.
